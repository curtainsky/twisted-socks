twisted-socks -- Client SOCKS support in Twisted.


Twisted[0] doesn't seem to have support for writing a SOCKS client.
The SOCKS support is written for servers and is restricted to SOCKSv4.

This package aims to add support for client TCP connections, with or
without SSL/TLS, to go over a SOCKS proxy, version 4, 4a or 5.


See the examples directory for an idea on how to use it. You can run
the http example like this:

    cd examples; ln -s ../socksclient.py .
    ./http.py http://google.com/

You can start a SOCKSv4 proxy server in the foreground by issuing 

  twistd -n socks
